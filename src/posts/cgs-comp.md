Who believes in integroup competition? The original debate was about the role of wars and raids in the emergence of altruism among unrelated individuals (see Bowles and Choi 2007, Turchin 2003, Boyd et Richerson 1995) and so on. There was question about how much wars do humans need to evolve as groups.  As such, intergroup competition was tied to discussion in **evolutionary biology**, and the coevolution of culture and norms and genes. It is about kinships, and kin-based institutions.

Joe Henrich is probably the author who did the most to extrapolate the role of intergroup competition in modern societies. Much like we domesticated ourselves, Henrich argues, we domesticated intergroup competition. Intergroup competition without conflict engaged with theories in **sociology** and **theories of the firms**, or how firm competition and market norms can lead to some of the same outcome of classical intergroup competition without any murdering. The spread of group-beneficial behaviors is also driven by ideas of differential reproduction and migration, as well as prestige-biased group tranissmion.

More recently, Henrich and Muthukrishna also engaged with **collective intelligence (CI) and team innovation** literature ([Henrich & Muthukrishna 2023](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/henrich/files/what_makes_us_smart_final.pdf)). In this context, they propose that findings in CI support ideas from intergroup competition. That organizational norms and policies are shaping the psychology of individuals, from the way that recruitement and membership works to the transmission of ideas in a open system.
