Cultural group selection is a bold move in cultural evolution theory, suggesting that group-level variation or traits played a key role in the emergence and maintenance of large-scale collaboration among unrelated individuals. The gist is that social groups with individuals willing to take a bullet for the group may outcompete those without such members. Why would people willing to take a bullet for the group, especially when the groups include people you don't know? To see why, let’s first consider how the Church successfuly accomplished that feat.

##  The Christian Church

The Christian Church has profoundly shaped social interactions in the Western world. Even today, it keep influencing ideas about whom to marry (outside your affinal kins, polygamy is still frowned upon), neolocal residence patterns (encouraging newly married couples to establish independent households), or norms around individual property ownership (you decide where YOUR stuff goes after you die). People feel like they choose how many children they want, but the idea of being a choice is a recent cultural innovation. Not so long ago, the answer was essentially, 'I don’t know—as many as God wants.' For women, this mindset is, arguably, akin to to take a bullet for the group.

As individuals, we feel our choices regarding, say, marriages and families are our own, but they are essentially pre-determined by institutions. Once again, not so long ago, individuals refusing to live according to social norms were severely frowned upon. In traditional settings, as it might be in your profesional work, your reputation is like a shield; when it is damaged, accidents might happen more easily, or opportunities might be lost. Cultural evolutionist consider social norms promoted by the Church as group-level cultural traits. 

Institutions are in part defined at group-level because they help reduce within-group variance, while maintaining between-group variations. There are a few ways in which institutions keep that ratio
   
Through the Church, individuals acquire cultural information that shapes their behaviors and systems of belief. Individuals evolved cognitive biases that enhance the accuracy of transmission of cultural information, which are bolstered by Church norms promoting repeated interactions. People may come and go, yet Sunday masses continue, maintaining continuity. 

Within-group interactions are further facilitated by symbolic markers, by which group members explicitly signal their social identity, but also language, shared ecologies, and even physical boundaries. These are barriers that effectievely prevent the blending of cultural groups, and facilitate assortment among its members. In cases where groups evolve altruistic traits that could be exploited by selfish individuals, this idea of positive assortment is essential to get altruism off the ground.
  
The Church also function as a web of interdependence, where individuals learn and take on different roles that sustain group-level traits. With dynamically evolving roles, the Church is actively discouraging deviance from established roles. Broadly speaking, the Church’s institutions foster COOPERATION among its members, through storytelling, ceremonies, and rituals, grounded in a collective (impersonal) "We-". 
  
Punishing deviant behaviors, repeated assemblies, norm-enforcing institutions specifying how to behave towards in-group, and other groups, all tend to reduce WITHIN-GROUP VARIABILITY, while preserving INTERGROUP VARIATION. That is, and this is the big claim, if the ratio of within group variance relative to between group variance is high enough, we could have in principle between-group selection! But this is often where we lack consensus; people don't agree that between-group selection is a strong evolutionary force, compared to individual traits. 


The Church, as an institution, is a good example of a social group from which a variety of norms arise and provide a framework for individuals to collaborate and coordinate. The Church is grounded in religious competition, without which norms wouldn't make sense.

Lets distinguish the Church as groups, or ensemble of group-level traits, from groups as many-body interactions. Groups as many body interactions exist in a physical sense; people feel pressured by a group. The group exhibit dynamics that are best understood as momentary interactions; both friends influencing you to get a new iphone. Momentary is a property of hyperedge, in which the influence take place. It can be over few at night, or perhaps over a month.

## Punk music

Consider punk bands: they consist of individuals, each playing a specific instrument, organized through institutions. These institutions dictate not only how many group members, which instrument, and when to play but also influence fashion choices, how to address the audience, who to admire, how to produce and distribute records, and so on. Through these shared norms and beliefs, band members can COORDINATE and COLLABORATE with each other and with the audience, spreading punk music. This coordination among differentiated members is one reason why we are talking about group-level traits; these roles cannot easily be expressed at individual-level.


The success of punk music also stems from individuals interacting within an institutionalized group. Consider how musician John Robb begins his oral history of punk rock:

<div class="cite">
      <div class="quote">
      Punk changed everything.  
      Not just our trousers.  
      Our lives.  
      Everyone came into punk with a different agenda, and everyone who left took their own version of events with them. And the rest of us stayed there, still burning with the bright inspiration of the revolution.
      </div>
      <div class="citation">- Punk Rock: An Oral History (John Robb)</div>
</div>

We might be tempted to explain the success of the punk music from an individual perspective. But the quote makes clear there was a sense of 'We-' that made punk successful. For the youth of 1970s UK, punk music resonated deeply—it didn’t belong to anyone. In this way, we can meaningfully discuss the spread of group-level traits, as what is transmitted is punk music itself, or more concretely, the set of interacting norms that is derived from it.
  
We can contrast punk bands with mosh pits, which arise spontaneously from a crowd reacting to the band’s performance. Note that there are rules and norms in mosh pits, and moshing has spread as a collective practice since the 1970s. In that sense, moshing exhibits group dynamics that are qualitatively different than mere aggregates like flock of birds. But individuals remain largely undifferentiated in this type of collective behavior. There is a 'We-' that moshes together, but the mosh pit’s hive mind and success don’t rely on differentiated roles or strong organizational norms.

Punk music is rich with symbolic markers, festivals, and practices—such as screaming insults at the audience or self-mutilation. Punks, like many cultural groups, are highly motivated for others to conform to their norms; if a band attempted to release records through mainstream labels, it would be severely frowned upon by the community. Similarly, a punk concert where the band forbids the audience to form mosh pits likely wouldn’t last long. A key observation is that, because punk music has norm-enforcing institutions, with individuals strongly differentiating themselves from other groups, variation in cultural behaviors will be greater across groups than within them!
  
Now, what if punk music as social organization is competing against other groups, say mainstream rockbands. In evolutionary theory, success is another word for fitness, which in turn is about survival and reproduction of whatever. It can be organism, but even Darwin realized that for humans, it seems that tribes, or music bands, including members who display "high degree of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good", could outcompete other bands; and this would be natural selection. 
  
Of course, unlike tribes engaged in violent conflicts, music bands don’t face literal eradication if individuals fail to adhere to their group’s norms. However, we’ve seen that punks are willing to go to great lengths because punk music structures their normative lives. The set of norms derived from punk music is what make punk bands unwilling to adopt mainstream labels, even though individuals could make more money as individuals if they do (like Green Day will do later on). This is a simple example of a cultural trait that is beneficial for the groups, but is detrimental to individuals. As such, punk music exhibit GROUP-BENEFICIAL TRAITS that have consequence for survival or reproduction of punk music, even if they entail individual costs. 
  
As evolutionists, we simply realized that we had the necessary ingredients for group-level traits to be subject to natural selection. Put bluntly, there is intergroup variation, this variation has consequences, and inheritance occurs as punk institutions spread either directly, through recruiting youth who start their own bands, or indirectly, through prestige-biased adoption by members of other bands. I must say this is still just an hypothesis, and that many people are still uncomfortable with it.

At the same time, we know group-level traits can persist over time and resist changes in membership. 
  
<!-- With high enough between-group variance, relative to within-group variance, we can show that between-group selection can have a bigger influence than within-group selection. That is, GROUP-BENEFICIAL TRAITS can spread even though they might be costly to individuals. -->
    
<!-- While individuals understand and imitate aspects of these institutions, they are best understood at the group levels. As we’ve seen, punk music emerges from differentiated individuals who coordinate through shared institutions. -->
