As part of my PhD, I got interested in how field of studies are increasingly becoming "computational". But "computational" means different things to different communities. What I had in mind by computational is something like "scientific works that rely on computer programming". This definition was a bit naive, so I started to look at paper embeddings to see the various use of it. 

Here are all papers on the S2ORC database mentionning the 'computational' keyword:

Here the colors represent field of studies (I annotated a few of them).  

<style>
  .image {
    margin-top: 2rem;
    margin-bottom: 2rem;
    box-shadow: 0 0 0 0.75px rgba(128, 128, 128, 0.2), 0 6px 12px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
    border-radius: 8px;
  }
</style>
