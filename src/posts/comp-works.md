Science is far from gender equity. Although there are more women at undergrad level, more women are leaving science later on. An interesting case study is that of computer science. Early on, women were relatively active in the field. There are many family stories describing women in the 1960s engaging in computer programming, as softwares started to emancipate itself from hardware. 

With the rise of personal computers, a cultural shift brought upon the idea that computer were for boys, causing women to stray away from the field. This cultural shift has many side effects in science, as computer science is core to the computational turn that science is currently experiencing. Many fields are starting to embrace computational methods to perform their work. Many of the boys who learn to code early already had benefti from that shift towards computational methods, computer skills being a trick up their sleeves to impress the crowd.

I argue that this early gendered advantage could very well lead to disproportionate benefits for men, particularly in fields who were traditionally more qualitative but becoming more computational.
