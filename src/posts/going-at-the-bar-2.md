  You see, now we are tracking the probability flow of moving from one state, say two sharks and two tuna, into another state, say that of three sharks and one tuna. This is a neat trick. We can now model exactly what is happenning over the <em>probability distribution</em> of groups, not just for a single group. With this move we are loosing track of specific individuals, but we gain the ability to represent that is influencing the different rates of transition. We might think that a single fish surrounded by a large population of shark is much more likely to get eaten then the other way around.
  <br><br>
  Consider the same set up, but for the evolution of cooperation where sharks and tuna are altruists and defectors. By having this network structure, that we call quenched in our jargon, we can easily represent the influence of groups on that of individual states. 
  <br><br>
  To your point, philosopher, we can assume that groups have a "mind of their own". The groups is trying steer their members in a direction that is beneficial to the group, but can be costly to individuals. The degree to which individuals are skeptical of the group actions can be represented as a function that influencing individual (rational) decisions. I know this is not individual intentionalities and that groups are not "intentional", but at least we have a kind of laboratory where we can start investigating the tension between individuals and groups!

  We have been thinking about evolutionary game theory on groups for a long time too! This goes by the name of cultural group selection, or multilevel selection, to distinguish that formalism from naive group selection (I won't go into that, but see the debate about Wynne-Edwards).

  <div class="dialogue">
  I like your effort, guys, but I feel we are still not talking about the same notion of irreducibility. At least now, we agree, agents and groups are represented. There is perhaps a notion of collective agency. But it feels that in your groups, or cliques, agents are all interrelated in the same way! And I know you say we will get there, I still doesn't see what I said what was the most important thing; again, <em>what is left when you substract the fact that each person acts from the fact that the group has acted?</em>

  You are very difficult to please. Yes, cliques are all the same. No, I don't have an answer to your question; i am not even sure what you mean by saying that. But common. Are we not getting somewhere? 
  <br><br>
  What is left when you substract the fact that each person participated or not to, say, a local composting program, based on their perception of the group, from the fact that the group has group implemented policies to encourage composting is a philosophical question. In my mind, what you are saying is that we need to know how the group itself has acted to be able to predict what will happens to the individuals, which is not nothing! We went a long way from our original model of midless social systems where humans are bouncing balls.
