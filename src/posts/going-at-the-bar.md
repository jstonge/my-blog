  <div class="parenthetical">FADE IN:<br>A cultural evolutionist, a physicist, and a philosopher walk into a French café, deep in discussion. As he serves their drinks, the bartender overhears snippets of their debate on the nature of groups. With a playful smile, he leans in and asks, 'So tell me, is this café simply the sum of the interactions among those who frequent it—or if, instead, it is something more?'</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    Well, that's the crux of it, isn't it? First off, you should know that there has been much debate about this in philosophy. John Searle (1995) is famous for this exact scene
    <div class="cite">
      <div class="quote">
      I go into a café in Paris and sit in a chair at a table. The waiter comes and I utter a fragment of a French sentence. I say, ‘un demi, Munich, à pression, s’il vous plaît.’ The waiter brings the beer and I drink it. I leave some money on the table and leave.

    Searle goes on to note how cumbersome interactions would be at the French café if we were constantly aware of all the norms and cultural conventions surrounding it. Paraphrasing a bit, Searle says we are like fish in water when it comes to social constructions, and that this water emerges from a 'We-' or COLLECTIVE INTENTIONALITY (CI) that is more than the sum of individual intentions. Thus, he argues that French cafés are IRREDUCIBLE to individuals because they possess an institutional reality 
    
    Philosophers have spilled much ink on the concept of intentionality. Consider the following. When 'I raise my glass,' my arm goes up. Ludwig Wittgenstein, half a century ago, asked what remains if you subtract the fact that my arm goes up from the fact that "I" raise my glass. The answer lies in individual intentionality. 
    
    In a similar vein, we can ask: 'when the three of us raise our glasses together', we raise our arms together. What remains if you subtract the fact that our arms go up from the fact that we raised our glasses together? Wouldn’t you agree that this 'We' who raise our glasses feels different from saying that each of us decided on our own to raise a glass? The answer lies in SHARED INTENTIONALITY.
    
    You get the idea. There's more. We can ask: 'what's left of the Café if you subtract the fact that 'You' and 'I' are engaged in cultural conventions and norms, such as cheering together and perhaps philosophizing a little at the bar?

  I love what you are saying, philosopher. I'm with you for the Café being more than the sum of its part. In our field, we like to think about "emergence". But I am hesitant to say you need intentionality to get that.
  
  Suppose we want to model the spread of French cafés in Paris. We might observe more cafés in one neighborhood and fewer in others. Typically, we would begin with the assumption that humans, or cafés, behave like air molecules bouncing off each other—an approach known as the LAW OF MASS ACTION. This isn't because we believe it accurately represents the world, but because it has proven to be a useful assumption. By positing that local neighborhoods adopt French cafés in proportion to the average state of the population, we gain insights into phenomena like CRITICAL PHASE TRANSITIONS. No intentionality is required; the social system is DETERMINED by the STRUCTURE and DYNAMICS of the NETWORK of cafés; but sure, here the network is a bit boring as everybody can be thought as interacting with everybody.
  
  We recently began considering irreducible groups, much like in philosophy. I should note that our use of "groups" has been somewhat inconsistent. Previously, we referred to latent structures underlying social interactions as groups, though we often called them COMMUNITIES. When we observe a highly cohesive subgroup—like the three of us—we also refer to that as a group, or sometimes a CLIQUE. We realized that in such cases, it might be better to model interactions for what it is; interactions involving more than just dyads. For example, when we cheer together, we think of it as HYPEREDGE, or cliques, as the phenomology differs from each of us cheering individually with one another. Same with households, coauthors on a scientific paper or group chats on social media platform. 
  
  Here's how I understand your question, bartender: 'under what conditions can we say that the interactions taking place in French cafés are HIGHER-ORDER, or irreducible to sets of pairwise interactions?' One answer is that group interactions relate to the dynamics of the groups themselves. Take our example of cheering. When my friends start to cheer, am I going to join in only with a probability proportional to the number of people cheering? No, if we decide to cheer, that probability is highly NONLINEAR; as soon as one raises their glass, we all follow suit, as philosopher would say. We see irreducibility in group interactions with the interplace of structure and dynamics of netowkrs; the probability that I raise my arm as others start cheering is more than the sum of INDEPENDENT INFLUENCES.
  
  With that in mind, we have developped very neat models that we can analyze with our mathematical toolsets. I guess one would wonder, then, what would we gain by adding this extra layer of intentionality? 
  </div>

  <div class="character">Philosopher</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
  This is an interesting question! Don't you want to model what makes humans special? Collective intentionality have tangible influence that I bet can mislead your simpler models. This is not just philosophy. Some psychologists are arguing that collective intentionality is a key feature of human psychology.
  
  Consider the work in developmental psychology by Michael Tomasello. As early as four years of age, children are highly motivated to enforce fairness in collaborative activities[^1]. In many studies, groups of children were asked to distribute rewards among themselves, varing the relative fairness of the distribution scheme. Researchers found that already at four children react strongly to unfair distributions, rejecting rewards that disadvantage them. Consider that, they prefer to receive nothing rather than be subject to perceived unfairness! As they, children starts making reference the "right" ways of doing things, which extend beyond the rules being established in MOMENTARY INTERACTIONS. They effectively are becoming agents motivated to uphold SUPRA-INDIVIDUAL CONSTRUCTIONS established by their group. 
  
  This sense of fairness is a simple example of how groups govern our social lives. As children are becoming moral agents, they are learning that morality doesn't depend on "You" and "I" doing the right things. They feel increasingly feel empowered by this more abstract "We-", which we can think of as the root of institutional facts. 

  What happens when you ignore that fuzzy layer in your representation of human networks? Let’s consider what was happening before you embraced higher-order structures. You felt motivated to explain the conditions under which higher-order interactions better represent social systems than pairwise interactions. Your argument was that hyperedges are more accurate for representing us cheering because 'that’s what it is' (your words). Make a similar leap in thinking once again: why is being an intentional group more significant than a mindless cluster of interacting individuals? Because that’s what it is!

  By accepting what we call this NON-REDUCTIVE interpretation of groups, you are confronted to a whole new world of modeling choices. If you keep all your representations as mindless entities, you miss the key idea of individuals acting in response to what they think the 'group is thinking'. By distinguishing group minds from the sum of individual intentions, we emphasize the role of intentional groups in shaping our individual lives. Yes, the structure and dynamics of groups matter, but humans are unique in how we vary in our responses to group beliefs and norms, perhaps leading to qualitatively different group dynamics.

  <div class="dialogue">
  If I may—Tomasello, the guy we’re talking about, is a fellow cultural evolutionist! His concept of 'We-' intentionality is a key part of how humans 'ratchet' cultural knowledge. This RATCHET EFFECT suggests that, rather than evolving big brains just to be smart, we evolved to learn strategically from each other. Shared intentionality makes us effective collaborators, while collective intentionality involve participation in perspective shifting and reflective discourse for leanring and internalizing beliefs of a social group conceived generally.
  
  For us, the example of children policing each other's actions makes a lot of sense too! Policing deviant behaviors of people close to you is a key feature of kin-based institutions. This can take a diversity of forms; as indigenous women in australia, it is tabooed to eat eels while pregnant. In the Pacific NorthWest, if you have received gifts as part of a potlach ceremony, you are expected to host your own potlach in the future, in turn distributing substantial amount your wealth among your past benefactors. As a young man, you must not sit near your tabooed female cousins, at the risk of being ridiculed. If you think this is funny, think about 

  one way group members increase the fidelity of knowledge transmission, while taming deviant behaviors. 
  
   bootstrap knowledge in ways that were previously unimaginable. This is called cumulative cultural evolution.
  
  What my tribe finds fascinating is the diversity of social organization, beliefs, and human adaptation witnessed around the world. 
  
  We think that this diversity relates to the ways we form social groups; for instance, ethnic groups often use symbolic markers to signal where they are from. If you wear a cross, or perhaps say the prayers before starting to eat, I'll know you are a fellow christians and might reach out for help. For us, the example of children policing each other's actions makes a lot of sense! In the evolutionary past, humans had to signal their group membership to each other for COLLABORATION purposes. It might be hard to imagine from today's perspective, but for most of human history, it wasn't about 'You' thriving at your job; it was about 'We-' thriving as groups.

  While we may not discuss group irreducibility, we are interested in how GROUP-LEVEL TRAITS cam explain cooperation among unrelated individuals. You see, we find that the modern synthesis falls short of explain how large-scale endeavors, involving genetically unrelated individuals came to be. In small-scale societies, cooperation can evolve through direct reciprocation, as individuals can track each other's altruistic behavior. Additionally, kin selection plays a role: when individuals are related, helping family members can increase the likelihood that shared genes are passed on to future generations. This is because the closer the genetic relationship, the more likely it is that aiding relatives also promotes the helper's own genetic traits.
  
  That said, we have similar ontological challenges; not all collective behaviors are group-level traits, and we also seek distinguish between aggregates and groups.
  The key idea for us is that the ways in which differentiation and specialization of knowledge and beliefs
  
  <!-- What is CI if not evidence that we are a fundamentally COOPERATIVE SPECIES? That is, humans are willing to incur large individual costs not only for the benefit of their kin but also for unrelated individuals. Put bluntly, I find mysterious that you guys are willing to take the next round, even though we are genetically unrelated. -->

  <!-- I don't know whether the café institution is reducible to the sum of individual interactions, bartender. But I think the café is a fascinating cultural output from our Western society! What i see as anthropologist is that French café are the product of strangers coming together in a place, which is 'owned' by someone who might not even be here. Most likely the café was built by people who didn't know each other, who engaged in mutually beneficial transactions because of some ideas of of trust and fairness. A mere 10,000 years ago, French cafés would have been unthinkable. Deciding with whom to make transactions, and even the concept of individual ownership, originally depended on blood ties and sister groups and collective governance! -->
  
  <!-- For us anthropologists, groups are everywhere, and we agree with philosophers that they are central to understanding the specificities of human social systems. From what I gather, we already have at least three definitions of groups: (i) ourselves as a clique raising our glasses together, (ii) groups of children policing each other's actions, and (iii) French cafés in the form of cultural conventions and norms, or supra-individual constructions. -->

  You are talking about GROUP-LEVEL SELECTION! Ah, here's a philosophically costly idea. How would that happen? Wouldn't groups need to persist over long periods of time to be subject to selection? What happens to the group "DNA" when group members keep flowing in and out? Can Theseus' ship have enough existence to become the target of selection over something as persistent as individual entities?
  </div>
  
  <div class="character">Cultural evolutionist</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
  Hold your horses! I didn't say that groups were exclusively the target of selection. Some refer to this idea as MULTILEVEL SELECTION THEORY precisely to avoid this trap. Recall the ingredients you need for natural selection: VARIATION in traits, which affects survival and/or reproduction, or FITNESS, and, finally, some mechanism by which variation is INHERITED. There are good reasons to believe that several mechanisms in human psychology and societes enable CULTURAL GROUPS to exhibit these features. 

  It is useful for groups to be strong collaborators, as you can outcompete groups of SELFISH individuals. By strong collaborators, it means that you are willing to pay large individual costs for the benefit of the group. A well-known example of that is, of course, the evolution of WARFARE (an idea that goes back to Darwin himself!). 
  
  Let's think about WARFARE for a moment, shall we. Warfare is an interesting example because, from an individual perspective, it doesn't make sense. Why would someone risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the group? Multiple lines of research indicate that the psychology of warfare makes individuals more inclined not only to adopt but to enforce group norms and beliefs. 
  

  <!-- Why do children are highly motivated to police each other's action? Because it help reducing the variation within-groups, while promoting variation between groups.  -->

  <!-- But this strategy of fairly distributing resources among a group is highly unusual; we don't observe it in our closest relatives, the chimpanzees. Among them, it is very much every individual for itself, regardless of the collective effort that went into capturing resources.  -->

  The development in children of collective CI is reflective of its evolutionary roots; at some point in human history, foragers started to COLLABORATE in ways that required rewards to be distributed fairly among cultural groups. 


  Consider variability in how cafés are managed: the type of decor, whether they serve beer, the arrangement of tables, location, and so on. In a cut-throat competition like Paris, certain cafés succeed based on specific practices. This variation attracts more customers and increases revenue, meaning that variation has consequences! Finally, when trainees at the most successful cafés decide to open their own French cafés, they may choose to adopt the same practices. From one perspective, these trainees embody the norms of their groups, resulting in a form of inheritance.  Some may prefer to think of this as individuals moving to new locations to open their cafés, but I would argue that the norms and practices that make a café successful are best understood at the group level! But this is really just a matter of preference, both can be simultaneously true. You know, tomato tomato.

  Okokok, alright. Let’s try to write a model with group-level stuff like you both want. Assume that groups are not mindless but intentional. How do I represent purposeful groups?
  </div>

  <div class="character">Philosophers</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
  I agree; this is challenging. We want to be able to distinguish situations where individuals respond to the norms of groups they identify with, which influence their behaviors and potentially feed back into the group’s actions. There’s an element of meta-cognition at work here. The states of both nodes and groups are influenced by an additional layer—whether it’s intentionality, beliefs, or perhaps norms of rationality and truth. Whatever it is, it’s certainly beyond the realm of mindless bouncing balls.
  </div>

  <div class="character">Physicist</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
  Okay, let’s start by modeling the coevolution of individual and group behaviors, and we can later explore how to integrate the intentional layer and the evolutionary stuff. 
  
  To make our social systems more mindful, we’ll incorporate GAME-THEORETIC considerations into our model. Game theory was developed to address some of your concerns, philosopher. It is a formalism that assumes the outcome of a situation depends on the strategies of the participants. 
  
  Before going any further, we should distinguish between CLASSICAL GAME THEORY, where outcomes depend on the (rational) choices of actors, and EVOLUTIONARY GAME THEORY, where strategies evolve over time and involve a notion of fitness. Be it rationality or fitness, something more is guiding the dynamics of the sytem than the structure and dynamics of the networks. Those "strategies" might not be the same than your collective intentionality but I believe this is a step in the right direction.
  
  Incidentally, some researchers focused on higher-order structures are also interested in non-reducibility; they assume that the relative COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS changes when collective benefits must be distributed among participants. But as far as I know, they also conflate they nonlinear effects in the dynamics with group interactions. That is, they are not engaged in the idea of modeling the "group features" as emergent properties, distinct from that of individuals. 
  
  Anyway, assume that the groups, or cliques, have a distinct state of its constituents. Instead of tracking individuals through network connections, we will decompose the dynamics of the system in classes of groups, distinguishing between their size and the proportion of individuals in a given states.. Here, let me draw something for you...
