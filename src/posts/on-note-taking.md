Interdisciplinary works involve understanding the distinctive flavours of different fields of science. For instance, how do sociologists talk about groups? What are the different takes of  max Weber and Georg Simmel on how we should think about groups? How do they differ from cultural evolutionists talking about groups? Or organizational scientists? 

My note-taking system to keep track and internalize all these ideas involve three different technologies; [Git](https://github.com/home), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). One technology to share my local notes (I don't like clouds, I like markdown) and keep track of how my notes are evolving. One technology that is pretty on the eyes and have a good search bar. And one technology to remember it all. Each of them integrating nicely with each other; writing Anki notes in Obsidian using [AnkiConnect](https://github.com/ObsidianToAnki/Obsidian_to_Anki), or by pushing Obsidian vault to Github. 

If we think of Obsidian is my hardware of choice for note taking , [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes) is the software by which I mostly internalize notes and concepts (augmented with Anki for easier remembering).  

There is much more to be said, this is only the beginning.
