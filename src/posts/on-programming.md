I want to argue that learning computer programming is unlike many other skills in academia. I think the reason is a mix of the following: *programming is trendy, easy to pick up, but hard to get right*. Lets look at what I mean by that point by point.

#### Programming is trendy.

In recent years, academic stakeholders have become increasingly focused on research output ([Piper 2017](https://chadwellmon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wellmon_piper_academic_inequality_ci_2017.pdf)). Programming facilitates "quantifiable" research output. With programming, you do nice charts and tables where it used to be words. There are more venues and conferences promoting computational output in fields that are traditionally more qualitative. And those are attracting increasingly more people (CITE).  New grants are put in place facilitate computational work, such as the [Digital Humanities Advancement Grants](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh). 

As long as science is well funded, maybe the fact that stakeholders prefering research output do not matter. But with all the stories about "The Death of Humanities" (CITE), one might think we are getting closer to a zero-sum game; the death of humanities is bundled with the idea that programming could save the day. Needless to say that many researchers in the humanities are not happy with that (CITE DH debate). 

Programming is also trendy in terms of what it can do; AI researchers winning nobels in physics make programming more trendy (i'll come back to distinguishing AI from vanilla programming later).

#### Programming is easy to pick up

Compare to other skills, programming is much cheaper to get started. To acquire the skillset of an experimentalist, you need to have experience in a wetlab. You cannot decide one morning to become experimentalist, just because you think it'll be nice. You need to get into a lab, and become familiar with the sociotechnical structure of wetlabs ([Latour 1987](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691028323/laboratory-life?srsltid=AfmBOor_dzvVj42fkEKnMuNy0qJ0rkmm2hrUzWEAKV5jy3SGFFQtjHqr)). With programming, you can decide one morning to write "Hello world" in a Python console. Although it doesn't make you a programmer, people just write more and more things in their console, without always taking the time to properly learn how to code. Maybe they don't call themslves programmers, but their research output now depends on their coding skills.

Technically, anyone can decide can decide one morning to start learning statistics or mathematics. But I doubt that anyone will call themselves a statisticians without going through some extensive study of statistics (maybe i'm wrong here). I never met someone who thought that learning mathematics could be a side hustle. If you want to learn maths or stats, you need to work hard. In comparison, it feels like people can feel like they can go a long way as programmer without engaging with the underlying theory and industry best practices. 

#### Programming is hard to get right

Computer programming is like the English language—many people think it’s easy to pick up. Stakeholders who don’t know how to code but are eager for computational output often assume it’s easy. But good code is hard to come by. Unfortunately, in many cases, research programs need to be good enough to run in 10 years, or at the very least, do not introduce artifacts that compromise the validity of the results. As soon as there is data involved, making sure the pipeline is replicable is a real challenge.

Programming is hard, but when people enjoy it is somewhat cheaper to learn. So programming is especially costly for people who just don't see themselves as such. And unfortunately, computer programming in the 1980s has been sold to young boys who embrace that one of the many programmer social identity for various reasons. As a results, there is societal bias in society about who feels like programming is for them. In that sense, this might not be so different from other STEM fields. Yet, what’s unique about programming is that women in the 1960s were active in the field, as it was once perceived as menial work—even though the problem-solving aspects were actually rewarding. Only when computer programming was realized to be creative and important then women got eviceted from the computer science (CITE).

One more point. If it is hard, why scientists do not let professional software engineers to do their work. First, most labs don't have that money. Second, professional software engineers, without any domain experitse, most certainly will fail to properly understand niche research questions. In cases where the research questions are clear, say in [normal science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_science), it might be fine. But as soon as we get into the muddy waters of research questions relying on some theoretical constructs, it can be harder to have researchers learning to code than software engineers learning to become domain experts.


#### Why the humanities?

The programming bandwagon exists in many fields, e.g. ecology, biology, experimental medicine, and others. A common thread is the shift among experimentalists or 'conceptualists' (those who traditionally write books without figures) who now feel the itch to learn programming. I think the programming trend has been particularly controversial in the humanities because, among other things, the objects of study are inherently inexact. I have more thoughts on that, but i'll keep it for another post.

#### Conclusion

Programming is different than any other skills because it combines being perceived as trendy by stakeholders (and even researchers), seeming easy to pick up (especially for stakeholders, but they themselves don't want to touch it), but is costly to get right. In some sense, programming is perceived as soft skill by domain experts but it is not. 

From a modeling perspective, how should we distinguish the emergence of computer programming in research teams from other skills. In some sense, we can just say this is different cost-benefit ratio. But I think [our model](https://jstonge.github.io/modeling-comp-transition/#gmes-hysteresis-base-model) is particularly well-suited compared to other skills because it captures the tension between group benefits (e.g., for stakeholders) and individual costs, driven by the 'cheap to get started, but costly to get right' dynamics. This dynamic doesn’t seem as present with many other skills. For example, a PI wouldn’t simply assume you should learn 'mathematics' on your own—it’s usually integrated into the curriculum where the research group operates.
