I wrote a small [observable framework entry](https://jstonge.github.io/overthinking/dawgs) for keeping track of the best directed acyclic graph in McElreath's Statistical Rethinking and his set of lectures. What i like about them is that they are some kind of building blocks for causal questions that are shared across the sciences.

p.s. This project is part of a larger project of writing interactive notes from McElreath's line of works. The source code can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstonge/overthinking/main/docs/dawgs.md).
