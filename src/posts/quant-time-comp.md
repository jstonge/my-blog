I've been thinking alot about what it takes to get a 'good enough' data system in computational social science (CSS). The 'good enough' part is really tricky. It depends on many, many things, such as the scope of the applications, whether you believe people will really try to reproduce your projects from scratch, or if you might have newcomers contributing to your codebase.

Here my attempt to distil the main axes of time and efforts for using Foundation Model (FMs) in scientific endeavors:

<style>

  h2 {
    margin: 1.5rem 0 1rem 0;
    font-size: 2rem;
  }

  .margin-note {
    width: 80vw; /* Make the element take up the full viewport width */
    position: relative; /* Position relative to its normal position */
    left: 50%; /* Move it to the middle */
    right: 50%; /* Align the right similarly */
    margin-left: -40vw; /* Pull it back to the left edge of the viewport */
    margin-right: -40vw; /* Ensure it stretches to the right edge */
    margin-top: 20px; /* Space between the text and the image */
    max-width: 100vw; /* Prevent it from extending beyond the viewport width */
  }


</style>
