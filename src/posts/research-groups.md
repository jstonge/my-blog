This [project](https://jstonge.observablehq.cloud/hello-research-groups) is where I experiment with ideas from my PhD thesis. Some of them might make the cut, most probably won't. In the project, I adopt a blog writing style, mixed with interactive data visualizations, to communicate my ideas for a number of reasons. Why? I enjoy that style of writing much more than a IMRAD paper. Also some ideas are not always best expressed as words, or in a static format (see [this blog post](https://cognitivemedium.com/tat/index.html) on new elements of cognition by Michael Nielsen for more).  

That said, ofthere is some value to produce [IMRAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMRAD) papers too. It is much easier to gloss at the literature when you know what to expect. Content, or the story, should not come at the cost of the medium. 

As I mention [on the project's home page](https://jstonge.observablehq.cloud/hello-research-groups/#project-philosophy) , I hope this project survive to become an [evergreen project](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). Too often, PhD thesis become frozen in time, never to be touch again. Why does it have to be like that?
