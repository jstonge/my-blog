## A word of caution about this idea
- we should be careful with that idea
- when looking at our most familiar behaviors, we are fish in water. 
- For instance, family. For the longest time, evolutionary minded researchers saw the nuclear family and man the hunter as making alot of sense when thinking about evolution
- they were wrong, their view of evolution was biased by their WEIRD upbringing
- to fix that, arguably, science needed a diversity of thinkers; here in the form of women entering the workforce
- we don't know what else might come out by inviting more diverse groups in science; this is exciting

## Prelude
- Cultural evolution is useful for contextualizing science of science
- Evolutionary lacking, and most importantly modelling, is lacking in fields like bibliometry and sociology of science
- this is probably not a coincidence, many evolutionary thinkers tried to apply evolutionary thinking to the social sciences; it often took the form of gene-centered reductionistic thinking 
- Lets try it again, this time around by recognizing that cultural systems, like science, are its own evolutionary systems that has coevolved with genetic systems but is not reducible to it.

## Main idea

#### Pitch 1: start from collective brain hypothesis
- The *collective brain hypothesis* in cultural evolution is that humans' unique innovativeness and intellectual feats--the one that led to take over the planet--are not about our big brains but our big collective brain. 
- It is the idea that humans' big brains is about tapping into each others's brain and know-hows in specific ways specific by social learning strategies.
- By having brains geared toward learning from your groups, and groups being embedded in a networks of interrelationships, humans have bootstrap cultural knowledge; creating cultural artifacts and shaping environments that lead to more elaborate cultural knowledge.
- The key drivers of the collective brain is thought to be; 
	- `population size`: the more the merrier, creating redundancy in innovative 
	- `group effects`: the units of human society are groups, not individuals. Many kin-based behaviors are rooted in our biology (and genes), but at some point in history humans became characterized by large-scale cooperation of unrelated individuals that can hardly be explained by genes alone. 
	- `network effects`; it depends on how the populations, and metapopulation, are connected; 
		- do you get to learn from what the neighbouring groups are doing or you are they are barbarians that ought to be eliminated, or worst, civilized.
		- how many teachers do you have access?
- What does the collective scientific brain looks like? At some point, some elites sought to create scientific institutions that will have its own set of rules, independent from the rest of the epistemic world. It worked, but perhaps not the way you would expect.
- The collective brain of early scientific institution was characterized, until recently, by elites. By definition, it means that
	- the population size was relatively small (compared to the growing number of urbanites); and stayed small for a long time (1700-1900, maybe not exponential; 1900-1960 maybe exponential, but only in the US; the rest of the world followed suit thereafter). 
	- but also, as theories became more elaborate, the counterpart was the emergence of  hyper-specialization (PhD awarded when you discover something new is without a doubt contributing to that). To become fluent in a discipline, you had to know all about the founding fathers; naturally, this led to parts of science being siloed; or poorly connected. 
	- The transmission of ideas from generation to generation was, mostly vertical, and characterized by strong prestige biased (CITE); some famous intellectuals get to transmit their ideas, while the rest get almost nothing (CITE). 
		- See [PhD training is no longer fit for purpose â€” it needs reform now](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00084-3) for Phds becoming misadapted to modern economy (and [Towards a Global Core Value System in Doctoral Education](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv2f4v5mf). Part of the problem is how PhDs are ill-suited to work in large teams.
	- A conjecture; 
		- the birth of an institution somewhat repeats what older, evolved institutions look like. It has to be. 
		- But with a twist, with a global top-down force and peculiar psychology that shapes the growth of the institution. 
		- It starts with smallish groups, that come together to based on some shared interests (voluntary associations) that had to do with facets. 
		- Early institutions are defined by the states seeking control over the population, and showing off to competing neighbours; public health, education, banking systems, lottery, technical disciplines (artillery, civil engineering, etc), even the social sciences.


#### The evolution of 'groups' in science

 - Early on, the groups are called scientific societies; they are local, and characterized by the fact that they have some 'principles'. For instance, _Accademia del Cimento_. 
 - Like monasteries, or various other clubs, they need to find resources to scale up their activities. Early on, this sponsorship mostly came from private donors. 
 - Early institutions often provided some services in exchanges of the sponsorship; Galileo was a well known astrologists, predicting events based on its reading of the stars. Membership was also not that random; family matters. It was often tied to religious beliefs.
 - To become more permanent, later groups like the *Royal Society* and *Academie* tied themselves to the states. The collective brain grew as a result of more resources; devoting money into fancy publications and building. They were instrumental to the crown.
