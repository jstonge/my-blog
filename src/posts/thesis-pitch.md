## Table of Contents


- How do we define, model, and measure groups is what this thesis is about.
- By adopting a modern view of groups, we can do better science.
- Can different commnunities thinking about group stuff start talking to each other?
- How do group thinking changes our perspective on particular systems? e.g. 
    - One of my favorite example is [[distributed consent]], and how shifting our view of consent from the individuals to the group level change fundamentally the problem. With the modern digital world, consent is not about individuals anymore.
    - A second example that I’ll talk more about later is that of contagion, and how groups adopt policies based on what other groups are doing. Policies is more than the sum of individuals.

## What are groups?

### A little history of group thinking

- We could go all the way back to Aristotle... if we wanted
- But I’ll start with Herbert Spencer
- Individual rationality used to be the mainstay of human intelligence, what make us special.
- But Spencer realized [?]
- And more broadly sociologists too talked about groups as having ``organismal'' properties. 
- We feel there is something there, but nobody ever put the finger on it. Groups are not organisms. They don't have a body. They don't have genes. As such, groups must be reducible to the sum of individual interactions.

### The first Great War: Natural selection applied to groups

- It was forbidden to talk about groups from evolutionary point of view, as individuals and genes is what matter
- People tried, but we had to wait until the 1990s to have anything scientifically grounded 

### Group rationality: towards a philosophical definition

- do groups lie? What is the responsibility of corporations in scandals? They are relevant question today.
- [[Paper 1: Opportunities at the interface of social ontology and higher-order network physics]]

### Collectie intelligence and adaptation: complex systems get into the game

## Collective public goods; group based game theory 

- Tragedy of the commons
- The state vs the individual; Cold War redux 

## How do we model groups?

- Ideally our definition shouldn’t venture to far ahead of our modeling prowess 
- From networks to AMES
- [[Paper 2: Opportunities at the interface of higher-order network physics and social ontology]]

## From the science of groups to groups changing science

- Nature is too complex for any individual to grasp; groups minds can help.
- But this requires us to change how we do science, as science is still very much about individual feats;
- We hire individuals not groups; individual submits thesis not groups; citation are individual based not groups.

### How do we measure groups 

- Ideally our models should venture too far ahead of our statistical models
- But models should be theory driven (vs team science literature)
- [[Paper 3: Statistical inference of group collaboration norms in science ]]


### Computational social science really need more groups

- This is especially true for comp science that work with observational data and that we need to be reproducible and shareable.
- Social scientists never learned to work together with code involved.
- This is where open source comes in and institutions must quickly adapt.

### Course catalogs; a proxy of institutional adaptations to the computational era (and more!)

- blahblah catalog blahblah

## Final thoughts
- when I started my phd, there was no chatgpt and I had no baby.
- This is not that my phd lasted forever, but the world is evolving very quickly.
- Historically, we never had stronger groups that when group boundaries were hermetic; wars, an elitist science, etc.
- This must change, we need diverse groups of people to work together.
- My thesis is really about pointing that fact out and trying as hard as I can that we don’t revert to the old ways.
- My phd is about producing _my_ thesis, but to rally people that have different point of view and skills to stand a chance against hate, dangerous rhetoric, oncoming pandemic, biodiversity loss and climate change.
