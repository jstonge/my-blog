I wrote a small [observable framework entry](https://jstonge.observablehq.cloud/hello-research-groups/results/timeline) for visualizing the evolution of both coauthors and papers for a given author. What I like about it is that we can see a wide variability of patterns of coauthorships and productivity, that we know are closely related.

In addition to the dodge dot plots, there is a timeseries of number of coauthors, with dots colored by relative academic age of coauthors. The line is the output of a bayesian switchpoint that looks for two different poisson rates.  It works well in some cases, but not others.

p.s. This project is part of a larger project of quantifying research groups in science. The source code can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstonge/hello-research-groups/main/docs/results/timeline.md).
