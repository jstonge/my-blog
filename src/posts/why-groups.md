The idea of social groups behaving according to their own set of peculiar laws, or group-level behaviors, is controversial (CITE). I explore how the controversy might be exacerbated by the fact that science is rooted in a WEIRD ontology. 

What is meant by WEIRD ontology? A striking example is that of individual responsability. In Western legal systems, we make a strong distinction between crimes that were intentional and premeditated from crimes done in the heat of passion. There are many studies showing that accidents thought to be unintentional are judged less severely by WEIRD than non-WEIRD people. Why? Most other cultures, or ontologies, have other their ways to account for responsability. 

In traditional societies, when accidents happen, people ask themselves <em>why</em> it happened. Why did that pieces of roof fall that exact moment where that person happened to be sitting. When looking for an explanation, they might appeal to witchcraft, meaning that this person who was sitting there might have had enemies.

Not all modern societies are willing to charge individuals over groups. [cite JAPAN studies showing how they judge groups more than people. Note that the law is more the tip of the iceberg. Causation is really a cluster of norms and expectations].

The idea of group-level behaviors is in direct conflict with the ways in which we hold individuals accountable for their actions. This is just one way among many others. Another related aspect of WEIRD ontology that is closely related to the Law is that of scientific discoveries.

In science, we reward individuals before anything else. The "myth of the heroic inventor" is this idea that scientific progress and innovation is the product of geniuses. I say lightbulb, you think Thomas Edison. This is deeply wrong. There are numerous studies showing how most discoveries were really a recombination of ideas that were floating around at a given time (see <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374710453/theweirdestpeopleintheworld">Henrich 2020, ch.13</a> for a glimpse of key individuals playing a small role in discoveries). Even if hold dear the idea that particular individuals are responsible for discoveries, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy">Stigler's law of eponymy</a> it often turns out that this is not even true. 

My point here is not that individual contributions are irrelevant to scientific progress. They are important in various ways; researchers are motivated by the feeling of discoveries, for instance. 

But the inability to take a step back from the <em>idea</em> that science is also (and mostly) the product of collective brains can lead to slowing down progress. Ronald Fisher, the statistical hero, is said to have interpred any question as a personal attack, publishing insults as retribution (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1np76s.7">Mcgrayne 2011, p.46</a>). His influence due to his reputation of being brillant meant that he could be overly influent on statistics as a field. As such, his grip is said to have prevented competing frameworks to emerge, such as causal inference and bayesian statistics. Fisher would not have any of that. Arguably, the idea of putting individuals on pedestals is very WEIRD, but something Westerners like to believe.

We saw that the WEIRD ontology is underlying how individuals not group should be held accountable for their actions and discoveries. Both of these ideas are ingrained in our scientific institutions, with rewards being attributed to individuals and oftentimes based on individual achievements. In some sense, it make sense. You can put medal around the necks of individuals more easily than that of groups. But does that make it right? 

Similar to how we attribute ideas to people, we like to believe science is successful in reducing complex phenomena to simple mechanisms. We were all taught that citrus fruits prevent scurvy, for example, but this understanding was later superseded by the discovery of vitamin C. Once we have that knowledge of this causative agents, we could easily predict the outcome of our actions. Similarly, if you go on wikipedia, it states that the cause for the COVID-19 pandemic is the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. We know the causative agents, we can predict the outcome of our actions, right?

Arguably not. The catch is in the idea that the COVID-19 <em>pandemic</em> was caused by SARS-CoV-2. Even when we knew about the transmission mechanism of the disease, we couldn't predict the outcome of our (public health) actions. Boldly stated, I think there is no reasons to think that the SARS-CoV-2 has epistemic primacy over cultural facts such as how different cultures adapted to the pandemic. 

If anything, our inability to act towards climate change is the cause of the pandemic because modern societies are decimating biodiveristy, which acted as a barrier againsts the emergence of zoonotic pathogen in humans. Cultural variations in mask-wearing and social distancing is the cause of the pandemic. Some groups delayed strong public health measures, until infection rates surged,  causing the virus to spread to countries that were doing alright.

Returning to our claim, does our WEIRD ontology, rooted in individualistic thinking, is what make the idea of group-level behaviors uncomfortable? I hope by this point the answer is, maybe. Does it make the group stuff true? Definitely not, this is not how it works. But looking at how scientists handle the pandemic, I think it would benefit us to think a little bit more about group dynamics and less about individuals.

[TODO: Maybe instead of ending like that, we can give example of benefits we are already seeing of taking a group-based approach, e.g. <em>institutional free-riding</em> is not an obvious idea if we stick with a pairwise approach of contagion.]
