Some hints:

  - `Institutions emerge from groups, somehow (groups think they know why, but they might not)`: "Groups that created institutions to protect the civic-minded from exploitation by the selfish flourished and prevailed in conflicts with less cooperative groups." (bowles_cooperative_2011) A natural history of institutions..
  - `Institutionalizing means making the stuff more permanent, somehow`: "using institutionalized punishment in small-scale societies as an example, we contrast two prominent mechanisms - selective imitation and self-interested design - with respect to their ability to converge to cooperative social institutions" (gavrilets_evolving_2019). Two meaning of permanence; the rules become more permanent, but also more formal. By becoming formal, they can become nonsensical and misadapted.
  - `Institutions is about actionable punishments`: "We shall represent the state of nature with the minimal institution baseline game (no covenants/no swords), then present findings from three environments with institutional configurations: (1) an imposed communication mechanism, (2) an imposed sanctioning mechanism, and (3) an imposed communication mechanism with either an imposed sanctioning mechanism or an opportunity to choose a sanctioning mechanism." (ostrom_covenants_1992)
  - `Group-level traits != institutions`: "Group-level traits are related, but not equivalent to institutions, which are “the laws, informal rules, and conventions that give durable structure to social interactions in a population” (Bowles 2004, p. 47). Instead, a group-level trait is the phenotypic effect of social organization. Thus, examples of group-level traits are the music rather than the rock band, the election of a leader who reflects the public interest rather than the democratic voting system, the sailing ship’s voyage rather than the crew positions, the economic surplus rather than the market economy." (smaldino_cultural_2014)
  - `Institutionalization process takes ressources` Coasce and people like north_institutions_1990: "It was possible to explain the existence of inefficient institutions, but why wouldn't competitive pressures lead to their elimination?" Inefficiencies and evolution. See Hahn (1971) for early case study in history of science about scientific institutions.
